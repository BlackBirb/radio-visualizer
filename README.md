# Rainbow Visualizer

I just wanted to play with audio analyser so i made... this.
You can change any variable on top of `visualizer.js` and you'll get different efect.
It was just a practice for me, anyone can take it and use, modify etc. have fun with it!
Also it's playing radio [CloudsdaleFM.net](https://www.cloudsdalefm.net) by default.
You can find me @ Discord  BlackBird#9999
